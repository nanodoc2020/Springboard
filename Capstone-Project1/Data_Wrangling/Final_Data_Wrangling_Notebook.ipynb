    "The Seeds data set can be found on the UCI ML Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds. It is simple to download and has a description of the parameters. Upon inspection it is clear that compared to most data sets in use today, this set is very small. There are 210 data points and 8 variables. Seven of these variables are numeric and essentially continuous; they are geometric properties of the seeds taken from precise measurement. The final variable is categorical, and gives the species of the seed with three distinct values: 1=\"Kama\", 2=\"Rosa\", 3=\"Canadian\". The size of the dataset might be one of the challenges to be dealt with. A number of ways to address this have been considered, including cross-validation, bootstrapping, and creating synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no missing values. There is, however, a mismatch of data in correct columns. After inspecting the original text file, the mismatched columns were easy to see. Some of the entries had, in random places, been shifted over to the right a column or two, leaving blank spaces where the information should be. This misalignment was present in about 5% of the row entries, and and causes an error when attempting to load the file directly into a pandas dataframe. Skipping these rows, the file can be read into a dataframe with 11 missing entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alert giving the rows seen allows us to open the file and write in an initial row that that is beyond the greatest column\n",
    "of misalignment. Doing this allows all of the data to be read into the file without skipping any rows. The consequence is that there are now extra columns that are full of NaN values. The actual corrupted data can be identified, stored for cleaning,\n",
    "and removed from the rest of the properly aligned dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "To align the corrupted data, it is simple to read the correct values into a list in the correct order, leaving out the NaN\n",
    "entries causing the misalignment. A function herein does this and returns a new dataframe with the data properly aligned and indexed. This is then appended to the uncorrupted dataframe, and sorted back in to the proper order. The result is a tidy dataframe with no missing values and everything properly aligned. The data is ready for analysis in a dataframe called seeds.\n",
